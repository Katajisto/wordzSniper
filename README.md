# wordzSniper

I am wrote a blog about this project at ktj.st! You can also find the pre-built project there. 

The program will not work without the dictionary, you need to download that from the blog (The dictionary is in Finnish). 
You need to provide your own dictionary if you want to use this with anything else than the Finnish sanajahti.
